FONTLOG for Anonymous Pro

This file provides detailed information on the Anonymous Pro Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Anonymous Pro fonts and any derivative works.

Anonymous Pro is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed especially with coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken for one another (O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them easier to tell apart in the context of source code.

Anonymous Pro is distributed with the Open Font License (OFL).
For more information, see the file "README for Anonymous Pro".
