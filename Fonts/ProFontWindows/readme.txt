WHAT IS THIS?

This is ProFont TrueType, converted to Windows TrueType format
by Mike Smith.

profontdoc.txt provides information about the original ProFont
distribution for Macintosh. I've added it to this archive, although
most of the information is not valid for this ProFont version.


VERSION NOTES

Version 2
Some text editors (VIM, MultiEdit) wouldn't use v1 because it wasn't
recognized as a monospaced font.
Thanks to Mark Anderson for fixing that problem.

Version 2 "tweaked"
This is ProFont Windows TTF, Version 2 "tweaked".
Based on v2.

Modifications include:
- A Euro character
- Missing characters from the Latin 1 code page
- Full support for CodePage 850. These are mostly the famous
  block/box characters you know from DOS. Very useful if you use
  Mightnight Commander through PuTTY.
- Fixed metrics so that point size of 9 works correctly. Until now
  you had to select 7 to obtain the native point size of 9.
- Added some quick&dirty hinting for point size of 9. Most characters
  now match closely the look of the bitmap version.
  Don't expect it to look good on anything else than Windows...


ATARI NOTES

Atari systems use Windows TTF files (if NVDI is installed), but they
are quite strict about the internal format, so some TTF fonts
won't run.
In v1, I added a special Atari version of ProFont.
Obviously this is not needed anymore in v2.

If ProFontWindows.ttf does not run on your Atari System, try renaming
the file to match the "8+3" scheme (e.g. PROFONT.TTF).
