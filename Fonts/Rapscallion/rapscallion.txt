Avast me hearties!!
RAPSCALLION is a FREE drunken debauchery-fuelled, pirate-styled TrueType font inspired by the Melbourne, Australia folk-punk band MUTINY (http://www.mutiny.com.au).  Basic punctuation has been included with a couple "special" symbols, Arrrh!  RAPSCALLION looks best when printed at 48-point or higher (so you can see the hacked-up style of the letters).

** Note that due to auto-formatting with "smart quotes" in Microsoft Word, single and double quotes will hsow up as non-printable characters unless you disable the smart quotes option in the Auto-Correct menu.
