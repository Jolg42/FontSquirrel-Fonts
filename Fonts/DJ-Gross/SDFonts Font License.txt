They are all for free. You are not asked to pay anything (paying attention is all I ask :-)).

Hope you will enjoy my fonts. Most of them has only caps and nothing more. This is currently changing, meaning that my fonts "will" have the most common characters, since I wanted to write in finnish and the Regular set of Letters doesn't allow me to do it. This is obviously for your pleasure. ;)

In any case you need more letters or numerals, contact me.
