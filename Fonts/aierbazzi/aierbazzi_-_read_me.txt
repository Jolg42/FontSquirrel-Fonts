Aierbazzi True Type Font
by Roberto Cecchi, www.civico201.com





I designed Aierbazzi to study possibilities offered 
by ordinary fonts to create illustrations in a simple way through 
combination / processing of some preset shapes (keys).

Letters don't follow themselves like in any other font, but they are put 
one above the other, like layers, to build a new shape made of pieces 
of each used letter.

This is a result born to grow the ideas that led me to bagarozz. 

Aierbazzi (that means "weeds") is totally free and you may use it for commercial
 and non commercial uses, without asking permission.

If You like Aierbazzi, feel free to leave me a comment in the "Aierbazzi" post 
on my blog ( http://www.civico201.com/2008/10/29/aierbazzi/ ).
