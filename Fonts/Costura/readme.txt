ABOUT THIS FONT
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I did Costura when i searched for a fontface with a real nice "stitchy" seam look. I couldn't find one that fitted my needs and taste, so i decided to make my own. By the way: Costura is Spanish and means "Seam".

The Costura Family comes with three weights, Regular, Demibold & Bold. It's published as OTF (OpenType Format), which can be used on both, Windows and Mac Os.
Standard German, Frensh and English alphabet, punctuation, currency signs and numerals are included. Some single steam strokes are included, too. These are: [ ] { } =


LISENCE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You are allowed to use this Font Family for private and commercial purposes.
