Jovanny Lemonad fonts do not come with an explicit license. Their website states:

"The project of freeware fonts is created by designers who have drawn, and after have allowed to extend the fonts free of charge. Everyone can take part in the given project. For this purpose it is enough to draw a font in any vector editor in uniform scale, then to send this file to me. If you have any questions, write."

He also writes:

"I am engaged in creation free fonts, generally the accidental. I like experimental typographics that strongly influences my works. For this reason still i do the difficult experimental things connected with fonts and letters. Since 2008 i do the project of free fonts, created by designers for designers."
